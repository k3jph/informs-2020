						* Most devolve election authority
						  * Local government entities run
						  * Counties/cities do nuts and bolts
						  * Share results with state authorities
						* State election authorities tabulate
						  * Tabulate multijurisdiction results
						  * Manage reporting and compliance

						## Presidential Elections

						<div>

						* Many moving parts
						  * The primaries
						  * The general
						* System has grown over time
						  * Mostly an <emph>ad hoc</emph> collection of processes
						* Almost none of this system was designed
						* And the Republicans and Democrats<br/>do primaries differently...

						## More About Primaries

						* These are *private* elections
						  * They are run by the state, but private
						* You don't actually vote for the candidate
						  * You vote for the delegates who vote for the candidate
						* Each state may differ in approach
						  * Elections
						  * Caucuses
						  * Scheduled whenever

						## Election Day!

						* You vote!
						* You may vote for a candidate...
						  * The state tallies up all the votes
						  * Allocates *all* of the states Electoral votes to the candidate
						    * Except Nebraska and Maine...because, of course
						* This is why the "loser" may win
						* None of this is Federally-run
						  * It's all done by the states

						* State certifies the results
							* *Only* 50 states and DC
							*o territories, other
						* Electors get selected
						* Electors cast their ballots
							* Which are usually the same
							* But sometimes, not
							  * "Faithless electors"
						* And all the Electoral College votes are sent to Congress

						## Mail-In Balloting
					
						* We've had mail-in balloting forever
						  * We call it absentee voting!
						* Some states already do exclusive mail-in voting:
						  * Five states, starting in 2000
						* Other states, notably California rolling it out
						* No substantive issues with security found
						* Higher voter participation found, but may not vote-stick
						* Voter fraud is basically non-existent

						## What Does This Mean?

						* The entire electoral system is extremely decentralized
						* No local area oversees more than about 10M population
						  * Los Angeles County: 4.3M voters
						* Mean county population is about 100,000
						  * Mean registered voters somewhere around 50,000
						* State rules differ from state to state
						  * Counties have some freedom in implementing rules
						* Many different standards and transfer mechanisms
						* Strong diversification of methods and mechanisms
